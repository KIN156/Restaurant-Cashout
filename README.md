# Restaurant-Cashout
This repository contains the code for a cashout system that assists servers and managers in doing cashout for their restaurant. The system takes in five values (total debit, total visa, total amex, total MC, and total sales) and provides output for total, total sales, less total columns, add house tip out, and total cash owed.
